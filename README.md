HAR File Analyzer ‚Äì Customized Network and Proxy Diagnostic Tool
Overview:
In support of our internal network operations and security infrastructure, a customized HAR File Analyzer has been developed to streamline and enhance proxy and network route diagnostics. Tailored specifically for our enterprise environment, the tool simplifies the analysis of HAR (HTTP Archive) files and offers unique capabilities that are not commonly found in existing solutions on the market.

üéØ Key Features & Benefits
‚úÖ Network Route Identification
‚Ä¢	Automatically detects the network path taken by HTTP/S traffic, helping to determine whether the request is routed:
  o	Directly via internal network
  o	Through a proxy service (e.g., Zscaler)
This insight is vital for troubleshooting issues related to access failures, routing loops, or policy enforcement discrepancies.

üîç One-Click Extraction of Unique Domains
‚Ä¢	Offers a dedicated feature to extract all unique domains from a HAR file in a single click.
‚Ä¢	Particularly useful for isolating domains during:
  o	Access issues
  o	Application onboarding
  o	Policy exception requests
This capability significantly reduces manual overhead and error-prone analysis traditionally involved in such tasks.

üîê Zscaler Authentication Redirect Detection
‚Ä¢	Identifies and lists all unique domains that trigger Zscaler 307 Temporary Redirects‚Äîa key indicator of authentication interception by Zscaler.
‚Ä¢	This functionality supports rapid creation of Zscaler authentication exceptions for SaaS applications and internal tools that do not support interception.
By surfacing these domains explicitly, the tool empowers teams to accelerate Zscaler policy tuning while minimizing disruption to end users.

üß∞ Built for Internal Troubleshooting and Network Design
‚Ä¢	Developed in alignment with our organization‚Äôs network topology and security architecture.
‚Ä¢	Helps network and security teams:
  o	Validate policy routing (GRE tunnels vs direct)
  o	Troubleshoot end-user proxy behavior
  o	Reduce time to resolution during incidents

üíº Use Cases
‚Ä¢	Network Operations: Quickly determine why a user‚Äôs traffic is being blocked or misrouted.
‚Ä¢	Security Engineering: Easily identify authentication redirects to fine-tune Zscaler access and bypass policies.
‚Ä¢	Application Teams: Use domain extraction to support the onboarding of new cloud services.
‚Ä¢	Support Teams: Provide faster root cause analysis during proxy-related escalations.
